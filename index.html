               <h2> Abeokuta, Nigeria </h2>
               <p>
                  I was born in Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria and lived there for the most part of my life, completing my
                  primary, secondary, and university education there. Abeokuta is a Yoruba word meaning "under the rock" and is
                  home to the popular <b> olumo rock </b> which was a fortress for people who were fleeing the intra-tribal wars that broke
                  out amongst the then Dahome people and the Egba people. Abeokuta is the capital of Ogun State and is a very calm town. 
                  Abeokuta is symbolic for having produced very iconic individuals including Professor Wole Soyinka, the first African
                  to receive a nobel prize in Literature, Fela Anikulapo Kuti, who is popularly regarded as the King of Afrobeat, amongst many others.

               <h2> Abuja, Nigeria </h2>
               <p>
                  Abuja is the capital city of Nigeria and is home to the top ministries, parastatals, and agencies of Government.
                  I lived in Abuja for two years. In Nigeria, graduates of tertiary institutions would normally undergo a one-year 
                  mandatory youth service program as a way of giving back to the country, and more importantly, as a means of fostering national
                  unity as there are over 450 tribes and ethnic groups. The idea is to deploy someone in say the Southern part of the country
                  to the Northern part so he/she can learn the culture there and acclamatize with the traditions and beliefs.
                  I was posted to Abuja for my youth service. My two years in Abuja were very remarkable years, decorated with growth 
                  and bliss.

               <h2> Athens, Ohio </h2>
               <p>
                  Athens is a college town and is home to The Ohio University. This was the first place I lived in on moving to the 
                  United States in 2019. I obtained my Masters Degree from The Ohio University. This college town is just the perfect 
                  place to arrive as an international student in the United States. I had such a beautiful community in this small town.
                  I stayed here for a period of two years, and made some forever relationships.

               <h2> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania </h2>
               <p>
                  This is my current city and my first real experience of the city life. I am pursuing my graduate degree 
                  in this city. This city has it all. It was very difficult to adjust to this city initially because of how lousy and crazy it
                  can get, but it is definitely one I have adjusted to better. This city is home to many of the greatest America histories and 
                  freedom fighters like Martin Luther King. Philadelphia actually means "brotherly love".
